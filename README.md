### Get exact province

```bash
https://provinces-of-turkey-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/provinces/:id
```

You can use this route to obtain the data of the province whose ID you entered.

City IDs were created based on license plate numbers. Each license plate number is unique so I thought it appropriate to set this route as a parameter instead of a query.

NOTE: The ability to search by province name has been removed for this route. Try using `/api/v1/provinces?name={your search query}` instead.
