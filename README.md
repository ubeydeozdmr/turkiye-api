# Turkiye API

API containing information about Turkey's provinces, districts, neighborhoods and villages (and towns).

## Domain names

The API uses [turkiyeapi.dev](https://turkiyeapi.dev) as the main domain. But you can still use the following domains:

- [turkiyeapi.herokuapp.com](https://turkiyeapi.herokuapp.com)

## What's new?

> _Latest update: November 9, 2024_

- Postal codes have been added to the provinces & districts. (Experimental feature)
- Improvement about the filtering system.
  - New query parameters like `minArea` and `maxArea` added to the get-all-type routes.
  - You can now filter by province name or ID in the Get All Districts route.
  - You can now filter by province/district name or ID in Get All Neighborhoods, Get All Villages, Get All Towns routes.

## Last Considerations

The v1 version seems to have started to lose its developability and maintainability. When I first started developing the project in 2022 (I had just started my first year of university at that time), the name of the project (and of course also the repository) was "Provinces of Turkey API". The reason for this is that during the first few months when the API was first developed, you could only retrieve province information (Also, this information consisted of only five properties: id, name, population, areaCode and isMetropolitan). Over time, I focused on fixing the bugs of the API and adding new features (one of them was districts). Over time, districts became a schema in their own right, just like provinces, but instead of being written separately with an ID-Key connection, these districts were written in the district arrays of the relevant provinces in the same json file. This is the first problem, I have largely solved this problem for v1, but there are still some problems. The second problem was that there was no support for query parameters at first. These parameters were added step by step over time (first added "name, offset, limit", then filtering parameters, then fields, lastly sort).

It is not easy to write the code from scratch without breaking the API requests of v1 users, however, I want to spare time for other projects and other work. That's why I'm taking a long break for this project. When the time comes, I will most likely start writing v2. Things I need to examine other sample APIs and also decide:

- Should I use database in v2 as opposed to v1?
- What kind of project structure should I create?
- Should I prefer snake_case instead of camelCase? (like area_code instead of areaCode)
- What kind of route structure should I use? (Should I use routes like "/provinces/34/districts/1852" instead of separate routes for provinces, districts, etc.?
- Municipality support was not added to v1 because it would have been a bit complicated if I had added it.
- What kind of connection should there be between Schemas? (How exactly can we position the municipalities when there is an order like provinces > districts > neighborhoods + villages)
- fields property cannot set quadratic (or more nested) props, also sort property does not work for all fields. How can I find a solution to this?
- Many more things I can't think of right now.

Because of all this, this time I will try to improve myself in terms of learning and plan well this time. The project has come a long way from when it first started and has much more advanced capabilities. Frankly, I think I've added enough features and made improvements to last until v2. I need some time to realize the things I plan to do for v2, so I'm taking a long break. When v2 is released (if it is released) it will have better and more descriptive documentation, be more systematic and expandable. You can still submit your suggestions, requests, etc. by opening an issue on the TÃ¼rkiye API GitHub page. you can write. In this case, I will also consider these for v2.

Best wishes!

## Towns

Important Notes:

- The scope of the v1 version of TurkiyeAPI (without municipal units) is to include provinces, districts, neighborhoods, and villages. However, since towns (a type of municipality) have an important place in the country, two routes have been allocated to them, just like neighborhoods and villages. In short, this is a patch prepared for v1. However, unlike neighborhoods and villages, they are not shown in the `/districts/:id` route, meaning they are isolated within themselves. Nevertheless, in these routes starting with `/towns`, the province-district names and IDs to which the towns are connected are specified, meaning you can connect using these if you wish.

- This is just a patch update (Check issue [#29](https://github.com/ubeydeozdmr/turkiye-api/issues/29)), in version 2 I will probably remove the `/towns` route and add the `/municipalities` route instead.

- `province` (string): It shows all the towns in the province containing or matching your search query.
- `districtId` (number): It shows all the towns in the district with the ID you entered.
- `district` (string): It shows all the towns in the district containing or matching your search query.
- `offset` (number): Used for pagination. Use this to set a starting point in search results.
