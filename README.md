API containing information about Turkey's provinces. It is still under development.

- [Area of districts](https://web.archive.org/web/20190416051733/https://www.harita.gov.tr/images/urun/il_ilce_alanlari.pdf)

## Known BUGs / TODOs:

- Province search functionality has not been implemented yet.
- Work will be done on some non-English characters such as "İ / ı".
- The province cannot be found when capital letters are used (a problem for some provinces, due to Turkish characters) will be tried to be fixed.
- API features will be tried to be increased.
